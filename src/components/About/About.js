              I am a Full Stack Developer from Chile. I like teamwork, solving
              problems and carrying out software projects. I am currently a Web
              Developer at Buenas Nuevas, where I have gained both technical and
              human experience. Mainly I have had to work with Vue.js and I also
              use Jira Software with Scrum methodology together with my
              colleagues. I like self-taught learning and I have no problem
              getting out of my comfort zone and using new technologies. In fact
              now I've been learning Go just for fun, I think it's a great
              language.
